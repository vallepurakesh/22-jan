     university provides resources and services for developing the material, in
which case joint ownership by a faculty member and the university is
acceptable (American Association of University Professors, 1999). Another
exception put forward by the AAUP is the situation where a faculty
member makes a contractual agreement with the university (or a third
party) to transfer part or all of his/her rights to the university (or third
party). However, by and large, most universities own the rights to
material, which is viewed as being part of the creator’s normal workload,
using institutional resources.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
          <b>At METU,</b> the ownership of online course material can be transferred to
the university if the creator wishes to do so. An agreement is signed between
the faculty member and the university whereby the member of the faculty
gives the full copyright to the university, in exchange of a one-off royalty
payment. In a way, the university purchases the rights to the online course. The
practice of royalty payment encourages faculty to take part in the university’s
online initiative.

      <i style="font-size: 30px;">Faculty Commitment</i>
      
    <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      In order to promote faculty commitment, the university needs to devote
resources to faculty development on the use of new technologies and instructional
pedagogies. Furthermore, specific incentives have to be developed to
encourage the production and delivery of online courses. These can be in the
form of giving release time for preparing online courses, reducing faculty
teaching load for traditional courses, establishing revenue-sharing schemes,
or counting contributions to Internet-based distance education towards academic
promotion. At METU, online teaching is considered to be part of
faculty’s normal workload, however, the effort is taken into account in the
determination of the university’s yearly academic excellence awards. In
addition, measures have been established for the distribution of revenues
among the various contributors to Internet-based courses and programs.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      Using the Internet for distance education also brings forth issues related
to the management of the underlying technology to ensure the continuous
operation, reliability, and maintenance of the system. Moreover, support
services have to be provided to faculty as well as students. Often, the
university’s computer center is a natural candidate for these tasks. However,
in institutional endeavors, as in the case of METU, care must be taken to
clearly define the allocation of responsibilities between the unit in charge of
Internet-based learning and the computer center. Currently, staff at the

      Informatics Institute are responsible for the management of the technology
supporting Internet-based courses and programs, including system administration,
software upgrades, user support, and security issues. The university’s
computer center cooperates with the Institute, advises when necessary, and
ensures that the infrastructure on campus meets the requirements of online
course and program delivery.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      During the design and development stage, three major issues need careful
consideration. The first one is related to the software platform to be used for
Internet-based learning. The choice of platform greatly affects the efficiency
and perceived value of online learning. The second issue deals with the
selection and approval of courses and programs to be delivered online.
Criteria for assigning priorities among courses/programs and the procedure
for approval by the university’s academic boards need to be established.
Finally, the issue of quality assurance for online instruction has to be
addressed in order to maintain the institution’s academic standards.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      The choice for the e-learning platform to be used for the preparation and
delivery of online courses and programs is between in-house development
and outsourcing all or part of the institution’s “virtual” operations. As
mentioned previously, there are a large number of companies providing
systems for online instruction, offering a wide spectrum of services. Considerations
of flexibility, customization, ease of use, scalability, and cost are
primary determinants for the final decision.
      
      
      </p>
      
      
      <p  style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      METU developed its own e-learning platform: NET-Class. The first version
of NET-Class was ready in five months. It is a learning management system
designed to incorporate features that add value to student learning and enable
instructors to achieve instructional effectiveness. NET-Class provides a userfriendly
and secure environment for creating, delivering and managing courses.
The system has three user views: the instructor, student and system administrator
views. Access is authorized by the system, and the related view is presented to the
user. The tools incorporated for each view are presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      Instructors can organize course content, generate tests, activate the
automatic grading utility, administer online discussion threads, and view
student access rates graphically with the tools provided by the system. NETClass
includes templates to produce core parts of a course like the syllabus,
announcements, and assignments. These templates ensure consistency in the
format of presentation, which prevents user confusion, especially for faculty
and students dealing with multiple courses. Students can take online tests and
exams, see their results in the grade book, and perform searches in the course
material. The system administrator is able to add/remove courses, register
students, change their passwords, and monitor resource usage. New features
and utilities are continuously added to NET-Class to promote active learning
and facilitate course delivery.

      <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Course Selection and Approval</h3>
      
      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
      The design and development stage also involves the determination of
criteria for selecting the courses and programs to be offered online. These
criteria are influenced by the scope of the institution’s e-learning initiative and
especially the nature of the target student population.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
                 Given that METU adopted an evolutionary approach for integrating
online instruction into its mainstream activities, the parameters used initially
pertained to the selection of existing courses from the curricula of various
departments. These include: the number of students enrolled in the course,
whether the course is at the graduate or undergraduate level, the type of course
(compulsory or elective), its frequency, faculty skills and willingness to
develop the course online, and the suitability of the department’s infrastruc

      ture (e.g., availability and adequacy of student computer laboratories) for
delivery. These criteria have later been expanded to cover the determination
of Internet-based certificate and degree programs.
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
Regarding the proposal and approval of courses and programs, the
regulations for traditional instruction at METU stipulate that all new courses/
programs are first approved by the related Departmental Board, then the
Faculty Board. New programs are further sanctioned by the University
Senate, followed by the Higher Education Council. Online courses and
programs follow the same procedure with a slight difference. If the course or
program to be delivered online is an existing course/program from the
university’s curricula, a proposal is submitted directly to the Informatics
Institute for support in preparation and delivery. Once the online version is
ready, its delivery has to be approved by the related Departmental and Faculty
Boards. On the other hand, new online courses and programs are first
approved by Departmental and Faculty Boards, and then submitted to the
Institute for support.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
The preparation of all the university’s online offerings is carried out
through the Informatics Institute. Priorities for course and program preparation
are assigned at the Institute, based on the selection criteria described
above. The Institute provides faculty training, equipment if necessary, and
support staff for instructional design, graphical design and programming.
Once the course is ready, it goes through an accreditation procedure.
      
      </p>
      
      
      <h4 style="font-size: 30px;">Quality Assurance and Accreditation</h4>
      
      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
          The accreditation procedure is an internal quality audit, instituted at
METU, specifically for Internet-based courses and programs. An Accreditation
Committee, established by the University Senate, evaluates all online
courses and programs. Accreditation is in two stages. The first stage takes
place at the end of course/program preparation, before online delivery. Each
course is reviewed to establish its conformance to the university’s Guidelines
and Standards for the Design of Online Courses. These guidelines, developed
at the Informatics Institute and endorsed by the University Senate, set out
details pertaining to best practices for instructional design, format, layout, and
navigation features of the course Web pages.
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: initial;margin: inherit;">
The second stage of accreditation takes place at the end of the semester
in which the courses have been delivered. The Accreditation Committee
assesses each course in terms of learning outcomes and effectiveness in using
the various instructional tools incorporated in the e-learning platform (e.g.,
use of the forum by the instructor to communicate with students and
encourage collaboration among students; the timeliness of feedback to
